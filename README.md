# mouse2002
a very tiny concatenative stack-based programming language, based on [MUSYS](http://www.musicainformatica.org/topics/musys.php) by Peter Grogono and Peter Zinovieff, rebooted by [David G. Simpson](http://mouse.davidgsimpson.com) in 2002 and hosted here, for all of eternity.

---
Mouse-2002, while a useful and expressively terse language, is incapable of computing `ackermann(3, 10)` in less than the age of the universe, doesn't know anything about strings, implements one continuous array, and overall does emobody the year for which it was named. This repository hosts a fixed and updated version of the Mouse-2002 interpreter found [here](http://mouse.davidgsimpson.com/mouse2002/index.html). 

<s>For the revamped and overhauled version of the language, see [mouse16](http://github.com/catb0t/mouse16).</s>

[This project](https://github.com/catb0t/c-projects/tree/master/calc) will eventually become the latest Mouse installment.
