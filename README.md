# Mouse 2002
A very tiny concatenative stack-based programming language, based on [MUSYS](http://www.musicainformatica.org/topics/musys.php) by Peter Grogono and Peter Zinovieff, "MOUSE" as described in Grogono's 1983 book "MOUSE: A Language for Microcomputers" and [rebooted by David G. Simpson](http://mouse.davidgsimpson.com) in 2002 -- hosted here, for all of eternity.

Mouse-2002, while a useful and extremely terse language, is incapable of computing `ackermann(3, 10)` in less than the age of the universe, doesn't know anything about strings, implements one continuous array, and overall does emobody the year it was designed -- 1979. This repository hosts a fixed and updated version of the Mouse-2002 interpreter found [here](http://mouse.davidgsimpson.com/mouse2002/index.html).
