# newmouse
a functional, imperative stack-based programming language, based on Mouse-2002

---
Mouse-2002, while a useful and expressively terse language, is not capable of a quine, is incapable of computing `ackermann(3, 10)` in less than the age of the universe, and isn't modern enough.

Currently, this repository hosts a fixed and updated version of the interpreter found [here](http://mouse.davidgsimpson.com/mouse2002/index.html), but in the future it will evolve into **newmouse**!
