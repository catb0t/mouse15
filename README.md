# Mouse 2002
A very tiny concatenative stack-based programming language, based on [MUSYS](http://www.musicainformatica.org/topics/musys.php) by Peter Grogono and Peter Zinovieff, and [rebooted by David G. Simpson](http://mouse.davidgsimpson.com) in 2002 --  hosted here, for all of eternity.

Mouse-2002, while a useful and expressively terse language, is incapable of computing `ackermann(3, 10)` in less than the age of the universe, doesn't know anything about strings, implements one continuous array, and overall does emobody the year for which it was named. This repository hosts a fixed and updated version of the Mouse-2002 interpreter found [here](http://mouse.davidgsimpson.com/mouse2002/index.html).

<s>For the revamped and overhauled version of the language, see [mouse16](http://github.com/catb0t/mouse16).</s>

[catb0t/c-projects/calc](https://github.com/catb0t/c-projects/calc) may eventually turn into a more modern reincarnation of Mouse, at far fewer than 18,000 LOC. Who knows :)
